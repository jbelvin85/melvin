Title: Commander (EDH) Rules Overview

1. Format Identity
Commander (formerly EDH) is a multiplayer-minded Magic format built around 100-card singleton decks and a legendary commander. It emphasizes social play, longer games, and communication over strict tournament balance.

2. Deck Construction
- Exactly 100 cards: 99 in the library plus one commander.
- Singleton: No duplicate card names other than basic lands.
- Commander Eligibility: Any legendary creature (or other card that explicitly says it can be your commander).
- The commander starts in the command zone instead of in the deck.

3. Color Identity
- A card’s color identity includes mana symbols in its mana cost and rules text, plus any color indicator.
- Every card in the deck must have a color identity fully contained within the commander’s color identity.
- Hybrid and Phyrexian symbols count as all of their colors; text-box symbols count too.

4. Multiplayer Assumptions and Setup
- Most games use 3–5 players.
- Each player starts at 40 life.
- Commander uses the London Mulligan: draw seven each mulligan, then bottom a number of cards equal to mulligans taken.
- Unlike some 1v1 formats, the first player in multiplayer still draws on their first turn.

5. Command Zone and Commander Tax
- You may cast your commander from the command zone; each time you do after the first, add {2} colorless for every prior cast from the command zone that game (commander tax).
- Whenever your commander would move to the graveyard, exile, library, or hand, you may replace that movement with “put it into the command zone” instead.
- Choosing the command zone replacement does not itself increase commander tax; only casting from the zone does.

6. Commander Damage
- Track combat damage dealt by each commander to each player.
- If a player takes 21 or more combat damage from the same commander during a game, that player loses the game regardless of their life total.

7. Banned List Philosophy and Rule 0
- Cards are banned for creating repetitive, unfun, or highly warping experiences rather than pure power level.
- Rule 0: Players should discuss expectations—power level, proxies, combos, and desired experience—before playing.

8. Practical Impact
- High starting life and singleton decks encourage longer games, big plays, and table politics.
- Deck construction revolves around the commander’s abilities and color identity.
- Knowing when to send the commander back to the command zone versus leveraging graveyard recursion is a key skill.
