# Melvin Documentation Hub

This folder keeps planning, development, and deployment knowledge for the Melvin AI assistant. Start here to find reference guides and active logs.

## Files
- `development.md` – requirements, architecture notes, datasets, and engineering roadmap.
- `deployment.md` – containerization approach, environments, and release workflow.
- `setup.md` – plan for the end-to-end setup/deployment script.
- `journal.md` – chronological log of significant decisions, outstanding questions, and next steps.

Update these files whenever requirements change or new discoveries occur so we retain project history.
